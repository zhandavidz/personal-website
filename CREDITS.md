## Typewriter effect on [`/index.html`](/index.html)

Used [typedcss.com](https://typedcss.com/). Specifically, I copied their [`/typed.scss`](https://github.com/brandonmcconnell/typed.css/blob/master/typed.scss) file into [`/defaults/_typed.scss`](/defaults/_typed.scss), and used that in [`/styles.scss`](/styles.scss).

## Image zoom effect on hover

Mostly inspired by code/methods found in [this article](https://css-tricks.com/zooming-background-images/).
