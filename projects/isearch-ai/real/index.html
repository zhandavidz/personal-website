		<h2 id="article-title">About the REAL Author: David Zhan</h2>

		<p>
			I am David Zhan, a junior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. When I made this in the Spring of 2018, I was an 8th grader at Albany Middle School, and this was the Multigenre Portfolio (MGP) that I made for my I-Search project. My I-Search topic was Artificial Intelligence (AI), as you can see, and I made many genres on the topic of AI. Everything that “Jack Wilson” wrote was actually written by me and is completely factual.
		</p>
		<p>
			The original website was completely made from scratch using the languages HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. This site has been slightly modified as my website hosting situation is now different, and it no longer uses PHP, but everything should still look and work exactly as before. Additonally, some external links may no longer work, as I have no control over external sites and it has been more than 5 years since I made this website.
		</p>
		<p>
			I really enjoyed making this website for my MGP, and I hope you enjoy it!

			I like to do many things, such as competing in science bowl, competitively swimming, and programming. I used to play play the tenor in my school's band and jazz band, and I still quite enjoy music. I swim for the Albany Armada Aquatics and my high school swim team, and swimming is something that I really enjoy. In addition to that, I also enjoy programming. I started learning a few years ago, and now I have gotten very good at programming, and I enjoy it a lot. The website on which you are seeing this on was completely made from scratch using the languages HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
