# My Personal Website

A repo for my personal website, which is currently live at [davidzhan.com](https://davidzhan.com). There are plans to upgrade this and make this look nicer in the future.

## Favicons

Currently favicons live in the `/favicons` folder, and the HTML tags to use them are autoloaded using `/defaults/head-tags.js`. Additionally, there is a copy of `favicon.ico` in the root folder so that browsers always have a backup (i.e. IE). **Copies of the original 512x512 logo are in the `/assets` folder.**


## Credits

There were several sites where I learned a lot of information on or used CC0/Unlicense code, and I give them all credit in [CREDITS.md](/CREDITS.md). This is both to give them credit and so I know where to look for more info when I want to do the same thing again in the future.
