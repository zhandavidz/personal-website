# My Personal Website

A repo for my personal website, which is currently live at [davidzhan.com](https://davidzhan.com). This is been hosted on many platforms in the past, but is currently hosted using [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

There are plans to upgrade this and make this look nicer in the future.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Credits

There were several sites where I learned a lot of information on or used CC0/Unlicense code, and I give them all credit in [CREDITS.md](/CREDITS.md). This is both to give them credit and so I know where to look for more info when I want to do the same thing again in the future.
